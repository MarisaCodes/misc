[Site deployed using netlify](https://stunning-crisp-a94947.netlify.app/)

1. Used bulma css and my own custom css to style the UI

2. Astro and JSX components for client-side functionality

3. Used nanostores to implement handling of theme of the website (currently only one theme available). In case new themes are available, implementing the "change theme" functionality will be easier with nanostores. (basically, a state management solution).
