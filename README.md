### What is misc?

misc. Is a blogging website made with astro js. The blogs are markdown files that live in the src/content folder. It has been interesting for me to learn and understand astro's approach to content management.

1. Used bulma css and my own custom css to style the UI

2. Astro and JSX components for client-side functionality

3. Used nanostores to implement handling of theme of the website (currently only one theme available, although I tested different themes while in development). In case new themes are available for example, implementing the "change theme" functionality will be easier with nanostores. (basically, a state management solution).
